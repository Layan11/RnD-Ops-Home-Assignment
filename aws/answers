(a) What are the parameters that will impact the price?
    The parameters that impact the price when creating aws instances are the following:
    - The region in which you deploy your instance.
    - Number of vCPU and memory size.
    - The type of instance you are using, for example if you're launching an RDS, different db engines vary in prices,
    for example MYSQL costs less than Aurora engine.



(b) How can you reduce the price?
    - Choose a cheaper region.
    - Lower the number of vCPU's and memory size if your workload doesn't require that much.
    - Chose a cheaper instance type which meets the requirements of your workload.


(c) What can you look at to optimize the cost?
    - You can split the workload across multiple Regions. If there are components that are not sensitive to network
    latency, you can choose a cheaper region for this workload, that may be far from your geographical location, and
    thus pay less money for the same workload.
    - You can use the AWS Budgets tool, which lets you set custom cost and usage budgets that alert you when your
    budget thresholds are exceeded or forecasted to exceed.
    - You can use AWS Auto Scaling, which monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain
    steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost, meaning you only pay for what you use and not for more
    resources that might be idle without you knowing or noticing.
    - You can use reserved instances as opposed to on demand if you know you are going to use the instance for a long
    period of time, since reserved instances offer a much cheaper price.
